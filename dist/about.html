        <p>I am currently in the second year of a four-year sandwich degree at Brunel University studying Computer science</p>
          <p>I have prior experience when it comes to developing games during my first year at university. For example, we were given a spec that told us to develop the 'Conway Game of Life'. I decided to plan out how I would approach this using an agile approach. The development of the project was very successful. This project helped me understand object-oriented programs as well as software design patterns.
         <p> Additionally, in my second year, we were given a group assignment in which we were told to develop an Android app of our choice. We decided to use GitHub for version control and to keep a safe backup on their servers. This was used effectively by the team, since we could make both commit and pull requests as well as keeping seamless updates throughout the life cycle of the project.
